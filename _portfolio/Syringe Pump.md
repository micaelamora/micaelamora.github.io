# Features

* **There are 5 buttons and a know accessible on the syringe pumps.** 
Starting from the left, the first button is the fast forward or mechanical forward button. When pushed and held down, the syringe moves at a rate of 25.65 mL per minute for the 20 mL syringe, and 15.85 for the 10 mL syringe. Similarly, when the second button, the reverse button, is pressed and held down, the syringe pump retracts at a rate of 25.65 mL per minute for the 20 mL syringe and 15.85  mL for the 10 mL syringe. The third button acts as the start and pause button for the automatic motion of the pump. Pressing it will push the syringe pump forward at the flowrate set as the default in the code, in this case, 5 mL per minute for the 20 mL syringe. The fourth button adjusts the rate to 5 mL per minute for the 10 mL syringe. The fifth button switches the flow rate from the preprogrammed options to being controlled by the potentiometer. The knob mechanically sets the pump rate. 
* **Interchangeable between 10mL and 20mL syringes.** This printer come standard with a MDPH2 extruder by Massive Dimension, which can extrude at a rate of 1 kg/hr. Unlike typical filament extruders, the MDPH2 uses a screw to convey and liquify plastic pellets before the molten material is pushed out of a large nozzle (1 to 5 mm extrusion diameter). Please note: This printer can also be configured for other high flow rate extruders, such as the Typhoon and Pulsar by Dyze Design.
* **Smooth and accessible design.** The design protects the electronics from intrusion by protecting the electrical components in a PLA enclosure. PLA was chosen for this component because of its rigidity and quick print time. The enclosure makes the buttons easily accessible to the user and protects the delicate electrical components by leaving very few holes into the enclosure, which are tight fit to their corresponding component. This includes the holes for the power wire, the wires for the latch, and a space to connect to the microcontroller.
